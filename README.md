## enable-2fa

A small CLI util to enable 2FA on your Steam bot accounts.

### Usage

Creating new Steam accounts cannot be automated, so you'll have to do that manually. Once you have your accounts and have added a phone number to them, you can use this tool to enable 2FA on them.

The tool will ask you for your Steam account username and password, and then for the Steam Guard code that will be sent to your phone. It will then, if successful, output the shared secret and the revocation code for the account.
